                  <p> 
                    I am a graduate student pursuing <b>Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering</b>, at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington, Seattle.</a>
                    </p>
                    
                  <p>
                    My primary concentration is in the field of Machine Learning and Robotics. I am currently a Graduate Student Researcher at the <a href="https://weirdlab.cs.washington.edu/">WEIRD lab</a> in Paul G Allen School of Computer Engineering, with my Advisor: <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/">Prof. Abhishek Gupta</a>. My research work currently is in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Robot Learning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Prior to my Master's, I served as a Scientist at the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in">Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)</a>, where my work was focused on AI-driven solutions for Radars and Tracking. My expertise in the role extended to real time operations and system design where I managed console operations for various ISRO missions and also executed different technology development projects like the development of the data processing software for the radar console and display.
                  </p> 

                    <p>In 2020, I graduated with a <b>Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering (with a specialization in Avionics)</b> from the <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology</a>.

                    <p>
                      I’m on track to graduate in June 2024 and I’m actively seeking full time job opportunities, specifically roles such as Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Scientist, AI Engineer, Data Scientist, or Robotics Engineer. I am also open to internship positions in Winter/Spring 2024.

              <p><b>Project:</b> Series Reactive Power Compensation for Grid Connected Open-end Winding Induction Generation Systems for Wind Energy Applications</p>
              <li>A new series reactive power compensation scheme was proposed for a grid connected induction generator system where
                it utilises both ends of the induction machine with one end of the winding connected to the grid and the other end
                connected to a capacitor fed voltage source inverter which supplies the required reactive power for the excitation of the
                induction generator.</li>
              <li>Performed extensive research, simulations, analysed the new proposed concept and designed a new current oriented
                control scheme where active power is being delivered to the grid by the induction generator without drawing reactive
                power from it.</li>
              <li>A grid connected open-end winding induction generator system with series reactive power compensation was first
                simulated in PLECS 4.3.1 software and then implemented on hardware for experimental validation using a digital signal
                processor (DSP TMS320F28335).</li>
              <li>A current oriented rotating reference frame based closed loop control scheme was implemented on hardware so that
                active power gets delivered to the grid from the open-end winding induction generator without drawing any reactive
                power from the grid for its excitation.</li>
              <li>The reactive power requirement for the excitation of induction generator is compensated by a capacitor-fed voltage source
                inverter so that it reduces the burden on the grid to supply reactive power.</li>
              <li>The proposed model was simulated and studied for the dynamic case where the speed of the induction machine is
                transient.</li>
