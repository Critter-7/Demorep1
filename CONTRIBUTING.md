# Contribution Guidlines
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Bug reproduction
- code
- Documentation
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
## How do I make a contribution? 
Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown!


1. Before contributing, take some time to understand the project's goals, structure, and existing codebase. You can start by reading the README file and exploring the source code.

2. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.

3. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.

4. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.

5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.

6. Use git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here" to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.

7. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

8. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".

9. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!

10. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.

11. Stay responsive to any feedback or review comments on your pull request. Make any requested changes or address any concerns raised by the project maintainers or other contributors.

12. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
